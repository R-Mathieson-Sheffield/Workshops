Lauded as one of the most important books on color ever written, artist Josef Albersâ€™s Interaction of Color is an essential volume. A full course in book form, this text demands a high level of engagement and investment. Albers stays laser-focused on his material and includes a set of exercises for readers to complete as they make their way through the text.
This volume by Betty Edwards, author of Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, serves as a fine introduction to color and color theory. A great choice for beginners and recreational artists, it covers all the information that would be presented in an advanced high school art class or introductory college course. The book is written in clear and intelligent language and includes a variety of exercises so the reader can gain hands-on learning experience.
