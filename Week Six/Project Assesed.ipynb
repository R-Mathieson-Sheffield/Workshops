The second column contains the integrated signal from the emission of a single molecule. The final (fourth) column contains the same data collected when no molecule is present, this represents the background noise of the detector.\n",

The numpy array contains two columns, the first is time in ms and the second is the integrated photon count. Load this data in to a variable, a good name is switchingData."

The fourth contains the photons collected from an area of the sample with no emitting molecules, i.e. the background signal.\n",
